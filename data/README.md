# Data

- Phylogenetic tree: `species_tree.nwk`  
- Phylogenetic tree with foreground branches annotated: `species_tree_branches_annotated.nwk`  
- Protein alignment: `alignment_protein.fasta`  
- Codon alignment (main, exons 8-10): `alignment_codons.fasta`  
- Codon alignment (full gene): `alignment_codons_full_gene.fasta`  
  
This is a modified version of the dataset from Christin (2007), which was simplified for this exercise.
